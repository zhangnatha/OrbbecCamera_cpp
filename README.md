# OrbbecCamera_cpp
This program demonstrates the acquisition, processing, and visualization of Orbbec 3D camera data using the Orbbec SDK, OpenCV, and PCL. It captures RGB images, depth images, and 3D point cloud data from an Orbbec camera, displaying all three in real-time with frame rate (FPS) overlaid on the images.
